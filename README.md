# project topic
We wanted to create something that allows the user to browse for books (s)he'll love to read and give the user an an opportunity to save future reads for later. The idea was not to lose track of good books but to have a place to accumulate a booklist that the user can edit at any time.

# project pitch
A book-browsing app that allows you to find and add books to your individual account as well as view/read a selection of open-source books in full in your app.
