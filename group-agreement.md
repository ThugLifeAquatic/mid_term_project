# group agreement
•Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?
- Morning standups every day: in our standups, we should have a list of items to hit such as progress, blockers, and possible solutions to blockers. This is also a good time to let teammates know where they are at emotionally or physically as well. 
-Yoga poses or morning air karate battles as ice breakers and a way to lighten up the mood each day.
-Try not to interrupt anyone. But since interruptions are a natural part of communication, build off of any interruptions in the group by acknowledging what the other person was talking about and what meaningful information or message we took from that.
-Understand that no one person is right.  Be open to others’ ideas and opinions. 

•Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
-If two or more people feel strongly about design pattern, we should:
1. get the rest of the group involved to get a group vote regarding how to proceed.
2. use rock/paper/scissors. Winner gets to use his/her idea. Loser gets to use his/her idea next time.
3. or get independent mediator or instructor to assist

•Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the C#, MVC Core Framework, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.
-make a scrum board
-try and pair program as much as possible
-be here by 9 am and leave when the group agrees to leave
-if a paired programming group is blocked for more than 15 minutes, we can involve others in the team to get a third or fourth eye

•Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs?
-the opposite pairs will review each other’s work
-merge to the testing branch only; once everything is running smoothly, merge to master
-we will only merge in merge parties, when the group as a whole is ready to pause what we’re doing to push to testing branch
•Anything else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
